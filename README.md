# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN):

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** using PyTorch. The goal is to solve the motion of a falling object under gravity, combining noisy data with physical laws (ODE constraints).

Motivation

Ideal for learners exploring model-based scientific machine learning and neural differential equation methods.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Setup

We model the height of an object under gravity:

\[
h(t) = h_0 + v_0 t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

- **h0**: Initial height  
- **v0**: Initial velocity  
- **g**: Acceleration due to gravity  

The PINN learns to approximate \(h(t)\) by minimizing:  
- **Data loss** â†’ Fit noisy measurements  
- **Physics loss** â†’ Enforce ODE constraint (dh/dt = v0 - g t)  
- **Initial condition loss** â†’ Enforce h(0) = h0  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Generates synthetic noisy data  
- Defines a simple feed-forward neural network (MLP) for \(h(t)\)  
- Uses **automatic differentiation** to compute derivatives  
- Implements a **combined loss** with physics, data, and initial condition terms  
- Trains the network to approximate the free-fall trajectory  
- Plots:
  - Exact analytical solution  
  - Noisy synthetic data  
  - PINN prediction  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

Install dependencies:  

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib

ðŸ”¹ Usage:

Clone and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pinns-freefall.git
cd pinns-freefall
python pinn_freefall.py


Youâ€™ll see training progress and a plot comparing PINN predictions vs true solution vs noisy data.

ðŸ”¹ Results:

PINN learns to fit noisy data while respecting physical laws.

Even with small data, the model generalizes well because of the physics constraints.

ðŸ”¹ Future Work:

Extend to PDEs (e.g., wave equation, heat equation).

Apply to real-world physics problems (acoustics, fluid dynamics).

Experiment with deeper networks and advanced optimizers.
