# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** in PyTorch for solving physics-based problems, such as the motion of a particle under gravity (free fall governed by the wave/ODE equation). 

### üöÄ Features
- Combines data-driven learning with physical constraints (PDE/ODE residuals).
- Implements a simple feed-forward neural network to approximate solutions. 
- Loss function includes:
  - Data loss (fit experimental/simulated data)
  - Physics loss (ODE/PDE residuals)
  - Initial/boundary condition loss
- Example: predicting height of a free-falling object using Newton‚Äôs law of motion.
